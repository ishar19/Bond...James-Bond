        James Bond is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica after leaving active
        service. However, his peace is short-lived as his old CIA friend, Felix
        Leiter, shows up and asks for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped
        scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading
        Bond on the trail of a mysterious villain who's armed with a dangerous
        new technology.

        When James Bond's (Daniel Craig) latest assignment goes terribly wrong,
        it leads to a calamitous turn of events: Undercover agents around the
        world are exposed, and MI6 is attacked, forcing M (Judi Dench) to
        relocate the agency. With MI6 now compromised inside and out, M turns to
        the one man she can trust: Bond. Aided only by a field agent (Naomie
        Harris), Bond takes to the shadows and follows a trail to Silva (Javier
        Bardem), a man from M's past who wants to settle an old score.
